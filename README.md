## About The Project


Face recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a subject through an image, video or any audiovisual element of his face. Generally, this identification is used to access an application, system or service. Our system has two segments, one is the detector and another one is recognizer. And entirely it works through the API from our system. Few biometric technologies are sparking our imagination quite like facial recognition.

### Used Libraries

This project was successfully built with the following libraries. To install the libraries and use the codebase, you should properly be aware of the version conflicts of tensorflow and numpy as well. But I strongly recommend to use Anaconda for that.

* [numpy](https://python.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Gymspaces](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Scipy](https://vuejs.org/)

## How it works

Based on the system of my project, the technical procedures has these breakdowns. Face Recognition API is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details.

* The face detection process is an essential step in detecting and locating human faces in images and realtime videos(on upcoming updates)
* The face capture process transforms analog information (a face) into a set of digital information (data or vectors) based on the person's facial features.
* The face match process verifies if two faces belong to the same person and pops up with a string of the detected person's name fetched from the database through API.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

## Results

In this section we analyze the performance of our mellowmax policy. Here, we compare the influence of the number of memory states of the fsc. It is expected that as the number of memory states increases the performance of the finite state controller should improve.
